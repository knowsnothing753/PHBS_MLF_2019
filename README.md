## Goal of the project
An inverted yield curve often signals an impending recession. We'd like to use the yield of the US tresury bonds to predict whether there will be a recession in the future.
## Data description
For now, our raw data has the daily and monthly yield of US tresury bonds with different maturities. For each sample, if there is a recession within a year we will classify it as 1, if not, 0. Moreover, We will do some feature engineering in the future, for example, considering the duration of each inversion. We will put more information after we finish the data constructing.
## Feature Engineering
#### Lag Term Generating

#### Duration of inversion

## Training Moldel and Predicting
#### Choosing ML Models and Lags

#### Comparison of Different Inputs

## Conclusion

## Improvement in the future
